# 11 Junior Pyhton Projects

## Project 1 Odd or Even (Par o Impar)

Welcome a user then ask them for a number between 1 and 1000. <br>
When the user gives you the number, you check if it's odd or even and then you print a message letting them know. <br>


## Project 2 Mad libs game (Historias Locas)

Ask the user for an input. <br>
This could be anything such as a name, an adjective, a pronoun or even an action. Once you get the input, you can rearrange it to build up your own story. <br>

## Project 3 Word Count (Contador de palabras)

Ask the user what's on their mind. Then after the user responds, count the number of words in the sentence and print that as an output.

## Project 4 Biography info

Ask a user for their personal information one question at a time. Then check that the information they entered is valid. Finally, print a summary of all the information they entered back to them.

## Project 5 What's my acronym?

Ask the user to enter the full meaning of an organization or concept and you'll provide the acronym to the user. For example:

+ Input -> As Soon As Possible. Output -> ASAP.
+ Input -> World Health Organization. Output -> WHO.
+ Input -> Absent Without Leave. Output -> AWOL.

## Project 6 Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a popular game played between two people. Each player gets to form one of three shapes using their hand: <br>
+ rock (a closed fist)
+ paper (a flat hand)
+ scissors (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V)

## Project 7 Guess the number!

You ask a user to guess a number between 1 and 50. <br>

If they guess outside that range, you prompt with an error encouraging them to choose a number within the proper range.<br>

Whenever they guess the wrong number you ask if they want to keep playing or if they'd like to quit.<br>

Finally, when the user eventually guesses the right number you congratulate them and show the number of attempts they had.<br>

## Project 8 Palindrome?

Ask the user to give you five words. Then check if any of the five words is a palindrome. <br>

A palindrome is a word that remains the same whether it's read forward or backward.

## Project 9 How much is the tip?

Your goal is to find out exactly how much tip you should give after receiving a service. <br> In this scenario, ask for the total bill. Then display the tip for 18%, 20% and 25%. <br>

Example:

+ Prompt: what's the total bill for today, please?
+ Input: $55.87
+ Output: 18% tip is $10.06, which brings your total to $65.93
+ Remember you want to be nice, so don't forget to round up. To push this more, ask for the number of people <br>involved, then evenly split the tip and total cost among them.

To go even a step further, split unevenly (for example, one person pays 70% of the bill while the other pays 30%)

## Project 10 Email slicer!

Collect an email address from the user and then find out if the user has a custom domain name or a popular domain name.

## Project 11 Time to sing! Lyrics

Ask a user to choose from a list of 10 songs. When the user does, you print out the lyrics to the song they selected.
